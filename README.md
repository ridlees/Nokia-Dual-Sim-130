# Nokia-Dual-Sim-130
A short story on how young guy failed many times


I own a Nokia Dual Sim 130, which I have found that this OS runs (nokia 30+) on C (its written by MediaTek). I have tried contacting the official support for documentation, unfortunately, there is none.

I have found a rar of this sofware which is attached here. The workaround is to change the code and use official Nokia Restore tool. 

Tried to add custom bat and c file, did not work. 

Attaching all the files I was able to get from the phone, unfortunately, I don't know the chip inside this phone (I borrowed it to a friend) which makes de-compilation hard (trying - onlinedisassembler.com but I don't know the architecture.

This is more as a entry to diary than project I have dwelved into.
